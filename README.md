### Introduction

The goal of this project was to get a Baxter device to play checkers (a.k.a. droughts) against a human opponent. Using a combination of inverse kinematics, camera detection, and proportional control, Baxter is successful in autonomously competing with a human rival.

### Overview

A series of nodes are necessary to get Baxter to operate. The interaction map can be seen below:
